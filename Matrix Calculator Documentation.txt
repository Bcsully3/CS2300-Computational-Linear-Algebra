This program takes in an input matrix and does a variety of 
calculations to it, including finding it's eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors. The approach I took to this was just solving it
one step at a time, and writing down pseudocode for each step to 
help me plan out the coding. I used a lot of references to 
tutorialspoint and other online resources
